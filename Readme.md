# DNS server docker container

This will be my very first docker container and I have chosen a DNS server because I am going to need to replace my home DNS server pretty soon.

It would be running, I hope, in a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes or Swarm cluster soon enough. At the moment I have only one board, so just Docker.
