# DNS server docker container

This will be my very first docker container and I have chosen a DNS server because I am going to need to replace my home DNS server pretty soon. It will come with the Zabbix agent installed.

I will try to maintain two branches one for the x86 image and the other for the arm image that should run, at least, in a raspberry pi.
